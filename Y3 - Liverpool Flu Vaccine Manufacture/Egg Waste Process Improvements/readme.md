Work relating to improvements to either the reliability or sustainability of the egg waste system (DMI). See screenshots from (1) activities relating to improving DMI performance and understanding processing/reliability data and moisture levels and (2) the net-zero report compiled for the same system as part of a separate project with WSP - aimed at scoping the pathway to eliminating direct carbon emissions from this very energy intensive system. These screenshots include a list of the options considered, their energy use and estimates of OPEX. Also attached is an experimental write-up for moisture analysis performed on samples of egg waste at the QC laboratories at Speke, this was to improve our understanding of the system's reliability (1)
