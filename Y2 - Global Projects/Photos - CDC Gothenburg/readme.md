Photos of the CDC project (Continuous Direct "powder" Compression) in Gothenburg, Sweden. I was a key project member during my year with GERE (Global Engineering & Real Estate. Included are photos of the continuous powder blender, tablet press and associated ancillaries. I was responsible for delivering a separate 3rd machine (Packoff/Vacuum Transfer Rig). This would take the finished tablets from the tablet press and transport them, under vacuum, to a weighing station and then automatically sort and pack them ready for a further coating step.
